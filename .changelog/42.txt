```release-note:note
Providers can now be muxed with a combination of terraform-plugin-sdk and terraform-plugin-framework server implementations. One option is the terraform-plugin-sdk server can be upgraded to protocol version 6, then muxed with the terraform-plugin-framework server. This allows using new protocol features in the framework implementation, such as nested attributes, but requires Terraform CLI 1.1.5 or later. The other option is the terraform-plugin-framework server can be downgraded to protocol version 5, then muxed with the terraform-plugin-sdk server. This prevents using new protocol features in the framework implementation, however it remains compatible with Terraform CLI 0.12 and later.

kind: BUG FIXES
body: 'all: Fixed a bug where muxed provider servers were not enforced to implement `GetResourceIdentitySchemas`, which is
    required by Terraform v1.12.1 in the scenario where at least one of the muxed provider servers supports identity. Before upgrading this dependency
    the Go modules that support identity should also be upgraded to prevent confusing errors, which are: terraform-plugin-go@v0.28.0, terraform-plugin-framework@v1.15.0,
    terraform-plugin-sdk/v2@v2.37.0, and terraform-plugin-testing@v1.13.0.'
